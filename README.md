# PI_LORD_Interface_Proj
For GTAA CBM project with SDIC lab. Client code to transfer data from deployed sensors to PI server and perform configuration and data processing functions.

## Overview
This package has been developped for the SDIC lab in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Waterloo as part of the Condition Based Modelling 
project in partnership with the Greater Toronto Airport Authority. It inlcudes modules for: 
1. Configuring the network of LORD sensors deployed at the airport 
2. Retrieving data written to LORD SensorCloud remote storage service by the deployed sensors
